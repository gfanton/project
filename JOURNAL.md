```

### CI/CD Infrastructure Added
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `tmux-integration-tests.yml` with comprehensive testing matrix
- **Multi-tmux Version Testing**: Tests against tmux 3.0a, 3.1c, 3.2a
- **Cross-platform Support**: Ubuntu and macOS testing
- **Quality Gates**: Test result validation and coverage reporting
- **Nix Integration**: Tests run in reproducible Nix environments

### Makefile Improvements
- **Simplified Structure**: Moved complex logic to dedicated script files
- **Clean Targets**: Simple, maintainable make targets
- **Script-based Approach**: All testing logic in `tests/scripts/` directory
- **Help System**: `make help-tmux` for documentation

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Plugin Testing Strategy**: Isolated environments prevent interference with user tmux sessions
- **Session Isolation**: Each test gets its own tmux socket and temporary directory
- **Cleanup Protocol**: Comprehensive cleanup prevents resource leaks
- **Script Separation**: Complex logic moved out of Makefile into proper shell scripts
- **CI/CD First**: Automated testing integrated from the beginning

### Key Components Created

#### 1. Plugin Test Helpers (`plugin_test_helpers.sh`)
- Isolated plugin environments
- Plugin installation and loading utilities
- Key binding and option testing
- Menu and popup functionality testing
- Plugin-specific assertions

#### 2. Session Isolation (`session_isolation.sh`)
- Per-test tmux socket isolation
- Environment variable management
- Cleanup and teardown automation
- Cross-test interference prevention

#### 3. Test Cleanup (`test_cleanup.sh`)
- Resource tracking and cleanup
- Process and socket management
- Temporary directory cleanup
- Validation of cleanup completeness

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- Multi-version tmux compatibility testing
- Cross-platform validation (Linux/macOS)
- Coverage reporting and quality gates
- Nix-based reproducible testing

### Testing Capabilities Now Available

## Session 2025-07-22

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Analyzed existing workspace feature**: Found comprehensive git worktree support in `cmd/proj/workspace.go` and `internal/workspace/workspace.go`
- ✅ **Researched tmux plugin ecosystem**: Studied tmux-test framework, BATS, popular plugins (tmux-resurrect, tmux-continuum)
- ✅ **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Added workspace feature documentation and recent changes section
- ✅ **Created comprehensive tmux-todo.md**: 8-phase development plan with detailed testing infrastructure
- ✅ **Prioritized testing approach**: Restructured plan to start with Phase 0 (Testing Infrastructure)
- ✅ **Designed testing architecture**: Nix-based environment with tmux-test, BATS, expect, and session isolation

### Key Discoveries
- **Workspace Structure**: `<projects_root>/.workspace/<org>/<name>.<branch>/`
- **Query Integration**: Supports workspace search with `:` syntax (e.g., `proj query foo:feature`)
- **Testing Gap**: Most tmux plugins lack robust testing - opportunity for best practices
- **Testing Stack**: tmux-test + BATS + expect + Nix provides comprehensive coverage

### Architecture Decisions
- **CLI Extension**: Add `tmux` subcommand to existing `proj` binary (not separate binary)
- **Session Strategy**: One tmux session per project (`proj-<org>-<name>`)
- **Window Strategy**: Multiple windows per workspace within project sessions
- **Testing First**: Phase 0 focuses entirely on testing infrastructure before feature development

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Phase 0.2**: Set up Nix-based testing environment with tmux-test submodule
2. **Phase 0.3**: Create test directory structure and session isolation helpers
3. **Phase 0.4**: Implement basic tmux integration tests
4. **Phase 1.2**: Begin adding `proj tmux` CLI commands with tests

### Files Modified/Created
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added workspace documentation and recent changes
- `tmux-todo.md`: Comprehensive development plan with testing priority
- `JOURNAL.md`: This development journal

### Development Context
- **Current Branch**: `feat/tmux-integration`
- **Base Project**: Go CLI tool with project/workspace management
- **Goal**: tmux plugin for seamless project navigation and session management
- **Testing Approach**: Test-driven development with comprehensive automation
